## 1. Design Principles

1. **Remote-first:** Every state reachable with Arrows + Enter + Back + number pad
2. **Fixed px sizing:** 1920×1080 CSS px (Tizen compatibility)
3. **Focus always visible:** One focused element per state; 3px accent outline
4. **Nothing destructive without confirmation**
5. **Minimum DOM:** Virtualized lists, reusable overlays
