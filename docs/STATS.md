# Download Stats

> **Inherited EN TV Player document (2026-08), kept for history.** It predates BabuşTV's V1 architecture and its statuses, file names and plans are not current. The numbers below are for the upstream EN TV Player releases. As of 2026-09-15 BabuşTV has release-candidate tags (`v1.0.0-rc.1`, `v1.0.0-rc.2`) but no published GitHub release assets, so it has no download statistics yet.

GitHub counts every `.wgt` download per release asset — direct installs and
Apps2Samsung bundle installs share one counter, so per-source numbers are not
available. Second-hand WGT sharing is invisible.

Refresh after each release:

```bash
gh api repos/Nur-allhi/en-tvplayer/releases --jq \
  "[.[] | {tag: .tag_name, downloads: ([.assets[] | .download_count] | add)}]"
```

## Active users

Active-user counting requires the opt-in anonymous ping
(`docs/TELEMETRY.md`). Until the ping endpoint is deployed, active usage is
unknown by design — the app phones home to nothing.
